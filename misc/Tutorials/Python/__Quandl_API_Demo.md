### Prerequisites

This tutorial requires the PyPDF2 library. If you access Python using Anaconda, PyPDF2 can be installed with conda by first adding the conda-forge channel as follows:


```
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install pypdf2
```

If instead you work from a stand-alone Python environment, open the command prompt (press Windows key + R. type "cmd" (no quotes) followed by ENTER) and type:

```cmd
C:\> python -m pip install pypdf2
```
