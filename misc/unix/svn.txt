#### CHECKING OUT A REPOSITORY ################################
svn checkout gets subversion to create a new working copy
from a directory stored in the repository

*first, obtain the name of the repo using svn info with
the name of the directory of interest:
$ svn info <repo_name>

#next create an additional working copy doing the following:
$ svn checkout file://<full_path_to_repo> <location_of_new_directory>





#commit changes:
$ svn commit -m "<message here>"


#add a file to repository:
$ svn add <filename>
$ svn commit -m "added new file"


#list files contained in svn repository:
$ svn list


#output a log of revisions:
$ svn log


#delete an item from the workign directory:
$ svn delete <filepath>
$ svn commit -m "deleted <filename>"


#display the difference between your working copy
#and the copy in the repository:
$ svn diff <filename>


#find the difference between to revisions:
$ svn -r R1:R2 diff <filename>


#update working copy to the repository's copy:
$ svn update <filename>


#to check out a version other than the latest:
$ svn checkout -r 7 <repository_full_path> <directory_to_store_files>

#to find out where a working copy comes from:
$ svn info <working_directory_name>
